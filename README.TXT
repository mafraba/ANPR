Automatic Plate Number Recognition
----------------------------------

This project is just a little personal experiment on Computer Vision, 
for academic purposes. Just making it public in case anyone may be 
interested for any reason. Technical documentation is on the way of 
being translated, and probably i'll put it directly on the project's wiki.

OpenCV library (http://opencv.willowgarage.com) is needed to build the application.

Any comments please write me to mafraba@gmail.com

Cheers,
